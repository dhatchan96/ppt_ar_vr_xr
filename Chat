The Problem Statement (Developer Pain Point or Inefficiency)

Please enter the problem statement in detail for your use case for Erica-Horizon Use Case Contest

Developers face inconsistencies and inefficiencies in estimating story points for JIRA tickets. Manual estimation is often subjective, time-consuming, and prone to bias, leading to unpredictable sprint planning and resource allocation. Additionally, developers spend time navigating past JIRA issues to find similar tasks, further delaying the estimation process.

Enter a clear description of the problem statement for your use case. State the current problem, the target state, and how this use case will enhance the user experience.

Current Problem:

Manual story point assignment leads to inconsistent estimates across teams.

Developers have to search past similar tickets manually, which is inefficient.

The lack of structured questioning results in subjective estimations.

Estimation meetings consume significant time, reducing productivity.


Target State:

A chatbot-automated process that asks a structured set of predefined questions to determine complexity, dependencies, and effort.

The chatbot retrieves historical JIRA issues to ensure data-driven consistency in story point assignment.

The system provides a suggested story point estimate based on past issues and user responses, reducing estimation bias.

Users can confirm or adjust the estimate before it is automatically updated in JIRA.


Enhanced User Experience:

Developers receive a guided estimation process, eliminating uncertainty.

Past similar tasks are automatically analyzed, saving manual search time.

The chatbot ensures a standardized and efficient estimation process.

Sprint planning becomes more predictable and data-driven.


Based on the problem statement, the teams will be evaluated to move to round 2 where document submission in the specified format is required.
