Subject: [Announcement] Octane Integration Enabled in QZRelease2 for Test Evidence Upload

Dear Team,

We’re excited to announce a new integration between QZRelease2 and Micro Focus Octane to streamline test evidence tracking during release promotions.

What’s New?

When raising a Promotion to PROD request in QZRelease2, users can now select the 'Upload Regression Jira' checkbox.

Upon submission, a backend job is triggered to:

Generate test evidence for the current build

Upload results to both the Landing Zone and Octane


Task status for Octane uploads can be monitored via the Octane tab on the release ticket.


Highlights of the Integration:

Supports large-scale test uploads in batches of 1000 (Octane API limit)

Background task tracking per slice

Retry mechanism on queue limits

Auto-delinking of JIRA from test runs if promotion is canceled


This feature brings improved transparency and traceability for QA evidence during the release process.

For more details:
Refer to the [Runbook Documentation] or reach out to the QZRelease2 support team.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
QZRelease2 Engineering Team
