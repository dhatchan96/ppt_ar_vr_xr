Subject: Octane Integration Guide & Regression Test Script

Hi Grant,

As discussed, Iâ€™ve prepared the documentation outlining how Octane integration is implemented for QZRelease2, specifically covering how test uploads are structured, authenticated, and linked (or delinked) to JIRA.

In addition, Iâ€™ve created a regression test script that exercises all the key APIsâ€”covering upload, test suite creation, automated run linking, and de-linking scenarios. This script should help illustrate how to organize and interact with test data using the provided Octane client interfaces.

ðŸ“Ž Attached:

Octane Integration Guide (Word document)

Script path reference:

Please let me know if you need a walkthrough or if you'd like me to assist in adapting this for your platformâ€™s context.

Best regards,
Dhatchanamoorthy
