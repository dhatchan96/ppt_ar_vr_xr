Here is the acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format for the ticket related to code cleanup and optimization in qz_remedy_client.py:


---

Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove Unused Methods

Given the qz_remedy_client.py file contains methods that are no longer used in the codebase,

When the cleanup script or manual review is performed,

Then all unused methods should be safely removed without affecting existing functionality.



2. Optimize Redundant Code

Given there are redundant or repetitive code blocks in the qz_remedy_client.py,

When the file is refactored,

Then such blocks should be optimized using standard coding best practices without changing the output or logic.



3. Pass All Unit Tests

Given the cleanup changes are committed,

When the test suite is executed,

Then all relevant unit and integration tests should pass without any failures or regressions.



4. Maintain Code Readability and PEP8 Compliance

Given the file is cleaned and optimized,

When reviewed using linters or code scanners,

Then the code should follow PEP8 standards and be easily readable and maintainable.



5. No Change in External Behavior

Given existing services or clients depend on qz_remedy_client.py,

When the cleaned-up code is deployed,

Then there should be no change in expected API behavior or data processing
