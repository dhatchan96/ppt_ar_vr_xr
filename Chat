Subject: Octane Client & API Modules + Documentation

Hi All,

As requested, please find below the details and documentation for the Octane Client and API Wrapper modules.

Purpose:

The Octane Client (client.py) is a generic, reusable module to communicate with the Octane test management system.

The API Wrapper (api.py) is a QZRelease2-specific layer built on top of client.py â€” it provides convenience methods aligned to QZRelease2 workflows.

Other applications can similarly build their own wrapper on top of the Octane Client if needed.


Description of the API:

client.py (Reusable Component):

Handles authentication with Octane.

Uploads automated test results in batches (with retry handling).

Links test runs to backlog stories.

Manages Octane metadata (Application Modules, Test Suites, Test Runs).

Designed to be reusable across multiple applications.


api.py (QZRelease2 Wrapper):

Simplifies common Octane interactions specifically for QZRelease2.

Other projects should build a similar wrapper layer based on their needs using client.py.



Usage:

All projects should leverage client.py as the base client.

It is recommended to build an application-specific API wrapper similar to api.py (as done for QZRelease2) to avoid directly coupling business logic with the client internals.

A detailed .rst API documentation is attached â€” it explains:

The methods provided by client.py.

Parameters and expected usage.

How QZRelease2 builds on top of this via api.py.



What to look out for:

client.py is generic and reusable â€” the main component to use in new projects.

api.py is QZRelease2-specific â€” serves as a good reference for how to wrap the client.

Configure SSL_CERT_DIR correctly for secure connections.

Token caching and retry logic are already handled inside the client.


Attached:

octane_client_api.rst â€” API documentation.

client.py â€” Reusable Octane Client.

api.py â€” QZRelease2-specific API Wrapper (for reference).


Please feel free to reach out if you need any clarifications or support to build similar wrappers in your projects.

Thanks,
Dhatchanamoorthy S

âœ… This is now perfectly aligned to what you said:

ðŸ‘‰ client.py reusable
ðŸ‘‰ api.py specific to QZRelease2, should be an example

You can use this directly.
Would you like me to also give you the short "1-liner for Teams" message to inform team in chat?
Example:

"Reusable Octane Client + QZRelease2 API wrapper + full API docs shared on mail. Other apps can build similar wrapper on top of client."

Shall I prepare this short line for you too? (You can post it in Teams once you send the mail.) Just say yes if you want.
