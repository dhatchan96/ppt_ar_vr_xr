Subject: ðŸ“¢ Integration of Octane with QzRelease2 â€“ Now Available

Informational


---

What is Happening?

QzRelease2 is now integrated with Octane ALM to streamline the process of test evidence generation and traceability. With this feature enabled:

Users can upload test results from QzRelease2 directly to Octane.

The system supports parallel uploads and handles Octane's queue limit gracefully.

Each slice of uploaded test results is tracked with status, viewable under the Octane tab on the Release ticket.

Regression JIRAs are automatically linked to test runs as backlog coverage.

If a promotion request is cancelled, the previously linked test evidence is delinked automatically from Octane.


This integration improves traceability, automates test evidence management, and ensures visibility into testing workflows within QzRelease2.


---

When is it Happening?

This feature is available to all QzRelease2 users starting immediately.


---

What Do I Need to Do?

No manual action is needed. This feature is activated when using the Upload Regression Jira option while raising a promotion request.
