Subject: Query on Controlling Upload Jobs via Fat Controller Considering Octane Queue Limit

Hi [Team/Name],

Currently, when users click the "Upload Evidence" button, the fat controller receives the request and spawns a job immediately.

Given that Octane enforces a queue limit of around 50 concurrent uploads per shared space,
can we enhance the fat controller to check if active upload jobs are already running, and if a limit (say, 2–3 active jobs) is reached, queue new upload requests until slots are available?

This could help avoid exceeding Octane’s queue limit when multiple projects upload simultaneously.

Please share your thoughts.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Highlights:

Mentions Octane queue limit (50 concurrent uploads).

Clearly explains current controller behavior.

Politely asks for validation on adding job-level queuing.

Professional and quick to read internally.

Would you like a second version where it sounds even more technical (if you’re sending it to an architect/lead engineer)?
(If yes, I can make a slightly heavier technical one too.)
