Got it! Here's your revised response with the explanation about the common test class:

Subject: RE: Release Manager Octane integration | Unable to pull more than 4000 automated runs linked to story

Hi Ramesh,

Thanks for the detailed explanation.

1. We tried passing the module IDs using the product_areas tag, and it’s working fine now. Please find the attached screenshot for reference.


2. Regarding the mismatch in test run count, we found that a common test class is shared between two different projects. As a result, the same class name is reused, which causes Octane to overwrite one run with another due to lack of uniqueness, as you rightly pointed out. We’ll be addressing this by isolating or renaming the classes to ensure uniqueness.



Thanks & Regards,
Dhatchanamoorthy S
