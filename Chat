Hi Team,

The Get Active Challenge kicks off on May 5th — and it’s time to get moving!
Registration opens tomorrow (April 22nd) on [My Wellness], so start thinking about how you’d like to participate.

You’re welcome to discuss with colleagues and form a team. Once your team is finalized, please share the details with us.

Whether you plan to create a new team or prefer not to participate this time, please use the voting option to share your preference by tomorrow.

Options:

I want to create a team

I’m not interested in participating


Note:
If you don’t consent to share your data, you won’t be able to join the challenge. Please let us know if you need any assistance.

Let’s stay active and engaged — looking forward to your responses!
