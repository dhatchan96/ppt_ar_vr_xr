Employee Summary (Drive Growth – What):

I have consistently focused on driving both team and organizational growth through innovation, mentorship, and cross-functional contributions:

Innovation through POCs: Contributed to initiatives like QZInsights, which visualizes Sandra data dynamically. These efforts help stakeholders derive quick insights and have the potential for broader adoption across teams.

Rapid Development of New Applications: Developed a full-fledged React-based web application in just three days for a functional demo. This showcased our team's agility and capability to turn ideas into tangible outputs quickly.

Mentorship & Capability Building: Took the lead in mentoring a campus graduate in the OpenTAP project. I ensured knowledge transfer, guided development best practices, and fostered early-career growth within the team.

Cross-Team Collaboration: Successfully drove Octane integration, which is now being adopted by other teams—extending the reach and value of our internal tools.

Engagement & Culture Growth: Organized team outings and conducted fun team-building games during meetings, contributing to a more collaborative and energized team environment.


These initiatives reflect my ongoing efforts to grow capabilities, encourage innovation, and contribute meaningfully to our team's overall impact.
