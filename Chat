Subject: 📢 Integration of Octane with QzRelease2 – Now Available

Informational


---

What is Happening?

QzRelease2 now supports seamless integration with Octane ALM to automate test evidence uploads and improve traceability. With this new feature:

Users can upload automated test results directly from QzRelease2 to Octane via REST API.

Regression JIRAs are automatically linked as backlog coverage in Octane.

When a promotion request is cancelled, the linked test runs are delinked from Octane.

The status of each task slice can be viewed under the Octane tab on the Release ticket.

The system supports parallel uploads, with smart handling of Octane’s 50-task queue limit.


> ⚠️ Note: This feature only applies to trains with a changeReleaseStrategy configured. Users on other trains must configure one to access Octane integration.



Additionally:

Only test evidence for the dedicated regression test story associated with the build will be uploaded.

The regression JIRA can be populated manually or pulled automatically from the associated Release Container.



---

When is it Happening?

The feature is available to all QzRelease2 users starting immediately.


---

What Do I Need to Do?

No manual setup is required. The integration activates automatically when:

A promotion request is raised with the “Upload Regression Jira” checkbox enabled.

A valid regression Jira is provided.



---

Need Help or Have Questions?

We will be hosting office hours twice a week:

One session for users with changeReleaseStrategy

Another for users who need guidance on configuring it


You can also contact DG Quartz SDLC Dev for additional support.
