Subject: Queries on Octane API Functionality and Background Task Tracking

Dear Octane Support Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I have a few queries related to Octane API behavior and background processing that I would like your assistance with:

1. Workspace Lookup by JIRA SPK

Is there any Octane API available to fetch the workspace information if we pass a JIRA SPK (Story Primary Key)?

Additionally, can a single SPK belong to more than one workspace within Octane?



2. Tracking Test Result Upload Tasks

After uploading test results to Octane, we receive a task ID as part of the response.

However, when we attempt to query the task status using the provided Task API, we are receiving a “Task not found” error. Could you please guide us on the correct method to track the status of the test result upload task?



3. Mismatch in Uploaded Task Counts

We have observed that the total number of tasks uploaded differs from what we retrieve when querying Octane.

Could you clarify if there are any known factors that may cause this discrepancy?



4. Tracking Backlog Coverage Updates

When we update backlog coverage (linking JIRA stories to test runs), the update appears to take some time to reflect in Octane and JIRA.

Is there any background job or task associated with this linkage update that can be monitored?

If so, could you please provide guidance on how to track its status?




I would appreciate your inputs on these points to help us optimize our integration with Octane.

Looking forward to your support.

Best regards,

Would you like me to also prepare a shorter version (in case you prefer a very brief one)?
Or I can also prepare this as a draft Word file if you need to attach it formally!
