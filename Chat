🎮 How to Play (Meeting Format)

1️⃣ Game Rounds

Each round consists of:

1. Task Phase (3-5 minutes)

Crewmates perform mini-tasks (trivia, riddles, finding objects, etc.).

Impostors pretend to do tasks.



2. Sabotage (Optional)

Impostors can create distractions (fake tech issues, ask confusing questions, etc.).



3. Discussion Phase (3-5 minutes)

The moderator announces a "player was eliminated" (secretly chosen by the impostor).

Players discuss who they suspect.

Each player votes anonymously (Google Forms, chat poll).



4. Elimination & Reveal

The most-voted player is eliminated.

If they were an impostor, the game continues until all impostors are found.
