Subject: Clarification on Octane Queue Limit Behavior for Parallel Uploads Across IPs

Hi [Team/Name],

I’m looking to clarify the queue limit behavior in ALM Octane during automated test result uploads.

We are currently planning to run 300 parallel upload threads using the same Octane credentials, but from different IP addresses (across distributed agents). I understand that Octane enforces a queue limit—typically 50 concurrent uploads per shared space or workspace—to maintain system stability.

Before proceeding, I’d like to confirm the following:

1. Will Octane enforce the queue limit globally per shared space, regardless of how many IPs or client systems initiate the upload?


2. Is there any advantage in distributing uploads across multiple IPs (e.g., bypassing queue restrictions), or is the limit strictly applied at the shared space level?


3. Is the “429 Too Many Requests” response expected when this limit is exceeded, and does Octane include a Retry-After header in that case?



This information will help us fine-tune our upload strategy, implement proper throttling, and avoid unnecessary request failures.

Appreciate your clarification on this.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
