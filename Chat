Subject: Issue Observed in Octane Integration with QZRelease2 - Mismatch in Uploaded Automated Tests

Hi [Octane Support Team/DevOps Team],

As discussed in the meeting, we observed the following issues during the Octane integration with QZRelease2:


---

Issue Observed:

There is a mismatch between the total number of automated tests uploaded and the number retrieved from Octane.

Additionally, when attempting to upload the tests into the Release Manager from Octane, the number of tests uploaded is different from the expected count.

Details:

Release Container ID: <Release Container ID>
(Example: Rm-uat-test-rpkwcms-62)

Workspace ID: <Workspace ID>

Space ID: <Space ID>

Application Module Name: <Application Module Name>

Application Module ID: <Application Module ID>

Additional Request:

Could you please also share the process or query details to:

Retrieve Workspace ID and Space ID from Horizon Insights (or the corresponding database) based on an onboarded SPK (Story/Backlog Item)?


This will help us streamline future onboarding and integrations.

I will update the above details before proceeding further.

Please let me know if you need any additional inputs or clarifications.
